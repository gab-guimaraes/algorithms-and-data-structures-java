/*
   LinkedList:
            - There's a reference to another node 23 -> 6 -> 15 -> null
            - Two types of linked list: singly linked list and doubly linked list
                (singly only one direction, doubly two directions)
    Singly Linked List:
            -  Head (the first node)
            - Unlike the array, we are not able to access a random element in a singly-linked list.
                (worst performance than array)
            - Unlike the array, we don't need move all elements past the inserted element.
